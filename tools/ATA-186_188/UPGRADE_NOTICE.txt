NOTE:  Users of ATA 186 v1.34 software (and earlier 
versions) may not directly upgrade to v2.10 or higher
software versions.  Instead, they must first upgrade 
to v2.0, then to v2.10 or higher.  For user convenience, 
a transition software image (transition.zup) has been 
included in this zip file. Users of v1.34 and earlier 
versions must upgrade to the transition image first.
