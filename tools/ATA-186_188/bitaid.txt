bitaid version 1.0

The tool will assist the administrators to modify or retrieve the precise 
bitmaps coresponding to configurations in hexadecimal format.  

The program will ask for the initial value, bit range and the new setting
(hit <cr> for retrieval), and it returns the results.

The "initial value" should be in hexadecimal format, the "bit range" could
be a single number (between 0 to 31) or a pair of numbers (<num>-<num>), 
the "new setting" should be in binary format (hit <cr> for retrieval).
The program will return the result in binay and hexadeciaml format (and
deciaml format for retrieval).
 
You may also consult the administrator's guide for more information 
regarding this tool.
