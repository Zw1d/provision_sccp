Using "zupinfo.exe" program for Windows / DOS

======================================================================

If an ATA software image has had its original factory name changed, and 
the original name is no longer known, this program may be used to 
recover the original name from the image itself.  Place this program 
and the image in question in a directory, and at the command line enter:

C:\> zupinfo <current_image_name>

The correct image name will be returned.
